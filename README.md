# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A fun memory game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The game challenges the player to follow and repeat an increasing sequence of colors.  
Each level adds a new random color to the sequence, and the player must click the correct order to continue.  
If the player clicks the wrong color, the game ends with a danger effect and sound, while also showing the highest score achieved.
